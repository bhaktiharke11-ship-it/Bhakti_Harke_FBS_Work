## wap to print all numbers in a range divisible by a given number 

start = int(input("Enter start of range:"))
end = int(input("Enter end of range:"))
divisor = int(input("Enter the number to divide by:"))

i = start 

print(f'number divisible by {divisor} in the range {start} to {end}:')

while i<= end:
    if i % divisor == 0:
        print(i, end=" ")
    i += 1
